# COM 240 Lab 1
### Python Cipher Scripts

These scripts are for COM 240 Lab 1.
q4.py is question 4.
question 4 features something I call a mirror cipher.
It takes the index of the current letter, then
indexes from the right of the alphabet string.
this mirrors the alphabet.

Example: "c" -> "x"
"c" is the 3rd letter, "x" is the 3rd to last letter.
